	abstract  = {Access control models are usually static, i.e., 
                     permissions are granted based on a policy that only 
                     hanges seldom. Especially for scenarios in health care 
                     and disaster management, a more flexible support of 
                     access control, i.e., the underlying policy, is needed.
 
                     break-glass is one approach for such a flexible support of 
                     policies which helps to prevent system stagnation that could 
                     harm lives or otherwise result in losses. Today, break-glass 
                     techniques are usually added on top of standard access control 
                     solutions in an ad-hoc manner and, therefore, lack an 
                     integration into the underlying access control paradigm and the 
                     systems' access control enforcement architecture.

                     We present an approach for integrating, in a fine-grained manner, 
                     break-glass strategies into standard access control models and 
                     their accompanying enforcement architecture. This integration 
                     provides means for specifying break-glass policies precisely 
                     and supporting model-driven development techniques based on such 
                     policies.},

	abstract  = {We present a metamodel-based approach for specifying UML notations for 
                     domain-specific modeling languages. Traditionally, domain specific languages 
                     are either defined by UML profiles or using metamodels. We provide a generic 
                     integration of these two methods supporting arbitrary UML profiles and metamodels. 
                     Our approach provides a bi-directional mapping between the UML notation and the 
                     metamodel of the domain specific language. We use OCL constraints that are embedded 
                     into the metamodel, for describing the mapping between the UML notation and the 
                     metamodel. Moreover, we describe an implementation, as ArgoUML-plugin, for arbitrary 
                     SecureUML dialects.},
